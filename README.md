This was a failed attempt to train a model to identify clothing based on my photo. It was for the purpose of trying to tell me what outfits I could make with what is currently not in the dirty hamper, etc.

The model was really inaccurate so I just lost motivation to keep doing this project. I was also just starting my first year at the University of Washington in CS.

I thought about it again with some more NLP/ML skills learned from Ellen and just challenging myself to read and write really good code that was more modern and clean (I still code like trash).
